Bitcoin Sentiment Analysis via Tweets
MarketPulse Analytics, a leading market research company, has started a project to estimate the public consensus on Bitcoin by analyzing millions of tweets. Your responsibility as a Data Scientist is to perform a sentiment analysis on the collected data and understand how opinions about Bitcoin change over time. In addition, you will answer crucial questions about user engagement on social media and evaluate any correlations with the price of Bitcoin.

The first step is to analyze the sentiment of tweets using a sentiment analysis model. For each extracted tweet, it will be classified as positive, negative or neutral, based on keywords, tone and language used. This classification will allow you to measure the consensus on Bitcoin on a daily basis.

Next, a time graph will be created that shows the change in sentiment day by day: - Positive Tweets: The number of tweets with positive sentiment on a daily basis. - Negative Tweets: The number of tweets with negative sentiment on a daily basis. - Neutral Tweets: Trend of tweets that do not present a clear value judgment.

The graph will show the evolution of public sentiment towards Bitcoin, highlighting moments of peaks or declines.

After the sentiment analysis, it is interesting to evaluate the engagement generated by tweets. In particular, you will answer these two questions: 
- Do negative tweets receive more likes than positive tweets? The average likes for negative and positive tweets will be calculated and compared, analyzing whether tweets with a negative tone attract more attention or interest.
- Do negative tweets receive more interactions (replies) than positive tweets? A similar analysis will be conducted comparing the average number of replies between positive and negative tweets, to see which type of sentiment causes a more heated discussion.

To add further depth to the analysis, you will explore the relationship between the change in sentiment and the change in the value of Bitcoin. To do this: - You will find the historical price of Bitcoin (BTC/USD) from reliable sources. - You will compare the changes in daily sentiment with the changes in the price of Bitcoin, trying to identify significant correlations.

This approach will allow you to answer the question: Does public sentiment towards Bitcoin have an impact on the price of the cryptocurrency? Or vice versa, do price changes influence sentiment on social media?
